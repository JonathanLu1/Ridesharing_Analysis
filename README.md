# Ridesharing_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we take the different city types that are within each state and compare them based on the average fare for the rideshares. The analysis breaks down the different types of genres of cities and compares each of the different prices of the fares that they receive. We use dataframe built from pandas to break down the data and place it into a graph to show the fares that they receive. We see the amounts of drivers within each city type and how they compare based on the fare that they receive.

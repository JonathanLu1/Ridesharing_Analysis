# Ridesharing_Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we take the different city types that are within each state and compare them based on the average fare for the rideshares. The analysis breaks down the different types of genres of cities and compares each of the different prices of the fares that they receive. We use dataframe built from pandas to break down the data and place it into a graph to show the fares that they receive. We see the amounts of drivers within each city type and how they compare based on the fare that they receive. 

## Results

From the data that we had pulled from the two CSVs, we can see that there is a significant difference between the three different types of cities.

We first use the data and pull out the different types of cities and then sum the fares for each city type. After adding up the fares for each type, we average them out to find the average fare per ride and per driver and created a separate dataframe to show the data the we had collected.

We were directed to organize the data from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019. Using this date range, we created a dataframe organizing it by weeks and summed up the fares from each city type into a pivot table.

With the pivot table, we created a graph in order to show the difference in pay between the city types. We can see that the urban city type far out ranges the suburban and urban cities in total pay. 

## Summary

We can see that the sample size from the urban population is the highest and has the highest volume of drivers within it, which may skew the data in their favor. The rural and suburban areas do not have as many drivers and still make a similar average. The rural areas and suburban areas have a higher average fare per ride, but the urban ones have the most ride count. I would suggest to try to enter the suburban or rural market, there may not be as many people needing rides but they do pay more and have longer drives. We can see that the urban market we see that the average fare per driver is extremely low and the total amount of drivers far outweigh the total amounts of rides that there were.

It will be much easier to penetrate the suburban and rural market, whereas the urban market is far too dense. There is a chance to make money in the urban market, but the amount of competition will make it hard and you will have to work extremely hard.
